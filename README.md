# otp
## A one-time-pad-based encryption and decryption system

This program allows for the provably secure encryption and decryption of arbitrary files using other arbitrary files.
The one-time-pad (OTP) scheme has been mathematically proven (by information theory) to be unbreakable without the key.

### Planned features:
- [x] General byte-by-byte encryption and decryption with pre-communicated keys
- [ ] Seeded random keys for much-less-secure but much-more-convenient communication
- [ ] Support for other alphabets?
